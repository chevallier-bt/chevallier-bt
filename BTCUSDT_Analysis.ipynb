However, as smaller timescales are used, there is a tradeoff between the macro-variables and micro-variables. I believe the micro-variables are more predictable using purely numerical methods, though with each smaller timescale there is a stronger element of randomness. It will be important to find the right balance between these three influences.\n",

        "\n",
        "The cornerstone of this approach is the grader function in the code block below. This is a compromise to label the data, since ideally the algorithm would be able to place both long and short orders, as well as vary the amount placed on each trade. However, I do not know of a way to allow the network to calculate the true value of a label during the training, as would be required for such a flexible algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead, I train the algorithm to always place long trades with specified stop-loss (SL) and take-profit (TP) levels. These levels are decided based on the following variables:\n",
        "\n",
        "*    Reward/risk ratio: The reward to risk ratio is the ratio of potential profit to the potential loss.\n",
        "*    Profit level: The desired TP level for the trade, in terms of percentage increase.\n",
        "\n",
        "Both the reward to risk ratio and the profit level need to be specified to the grader function. The last missing piece is the amount of data points to check for the specified TP/SL levels. Of course, I could let the algorithm go on forever until either the TP or SL is triggered, but since the algorithm is designed to work on short timescales, I should limit the grader function to work in this scope.\n",
        "\n",
        "With all these variables, the grader function executes as follows. Given the arguments:\n",
        "* df     : A dataframe of shape (1,X) with all the closing prices is sent to the function.\n",
        "* profit : The desired profit percentage on the trade\n",

        "* n      :The amount of data points to check\n",
        "\n",
        "For every data point in 'df', the function will iterate over the next 'n' data points immediately following the current data point d[i]. If at any point d[i] exceeds the TP level (1+profit) or falls below the SL level (1-$profit/rr) then the current loop iteration will break and return 1 or 0.

My first instinct is that perhaps I'm not treating the LSTM properly. I've been treating it like a classifier, but I think I should be treating it like a regression algorithm. Currently, my grader function classifies a data point as either being a good long trade, or a good short trade. The idea was then the model would be able to provide a binary 0 or 1 result. As I understand it, the LSTM would be better at predicting a continuous value, such as the closing price increase from one point to the next.\n",

If I could somehow encorporate both how long it took to find the trade, as well as the resulting trade polarity. I know that the negatives will indicate a short trade, and positive will encode a long trade. I think the simplest approach seems to be to score the data uniformly, aka -1 for a short, or +1 for a long. However, this fails to capture the length of time it took to find the trade. Since I am specifying the trade parameters, I think I should incentivise trades that are executed quickly. Because of this, I'll try first using some kind of scale that incentivises quick trades over long ones, such as an inverse exponential.\n",

Because I am now weighing the results based on how fast they are, both results will be non-zero. I can then take the absolute value of both, and the smallest one means it executed first. This will always be true for any distribution where the incentive is strictly decreasing as you interate along looking for the trade. \n",

        "## Summary\n",
        "\n",
        "In the end, here are the key points:\n",
        "\n",
        "### DataPrep Function\n",
        "The final DataPrep function, which takes DataFrame input with known formatting. This function will:\n",
        "* Remove desired columns\n",
        "* Add desired technical indicators\n",
        "* Grade the data using the grader function, which assigns a value in [-1, 0, 1] depending on the result of the trade\n",
        "* Split the data into training and testing sets, which are already batched for use in the LSTM as 3-D tensors\n",
        "\n",
        "All of the above points are able to be modified through the arguments sent to the DataPrep function.\n",
        "\n",
        "The DataPrep function went through two iterations, the first of which simply normalized all the data across the entire set. This seemed counterintuitive to me once I thought more about it, as the more important piece of data is the relative change between data points, not the absolute value.\n",
        "\n",
        "The second iteration of the DataPrep function addressed this by scaling the data relative to the previous value. That is, if point A had a value of 100 and point B had a value of 110, point B would be replace with a 1.1, meaning it was 1.1x(point A). The first element was chosen to have a value of 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Grader Function\n",
        "The final Grader function, which takes the DataFrame column of closing prices. This function also takes the desired profit, reward/risk ratio, and number of timesteps, in order to calculate whether or not a trade at each point would result in a success. This result is encoded as an element of [-1, 0, 1], depending on whether or not a short trade would succeed, the trade was indeterminate, or a long trade would succeed, respectively.\n",
        "\n",
        "Because the Grader and DataPrep functions were so closely related, the Grader function also had two iterations. In the first iteration, the Grader function considered the absolute price levels in order to determine if the trade was successful. This got more complicated when the DataPrep function scaled the data to be relative. The final Grader function used different math to compare whether or not the trade was successful, based on the sequential relative increases in price from one data point to the next.\n",
        "\n",
        "### LSTM Network \n",
        "\n",
        "Likely the weakest part of the project, my implementation of the LSTM network was likely lacking in several key areas. While I don't know them now, I will continue to work on this project and hopefully reach a point where I understand where all my shortcomings were located. My initial list of guesses looks something like this:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Perhaps the data being normalized holds more weight than I gave credit\n",
        "* Custom metrics for accuracy which exclude the indeterminate trades would provide stronger insight\n",
        "* Using more combinations of TAs to see if performance of the model increases\n",
        "\n",
        "**The single most important factor, in my opinion, is the loss function**\n",
        "\n",
        "I think a custom loss function is the single best improvement I can make for this type of problem. I think there is nothing inherently wrong with the classifier approach I have taken, but no loss function properly takes it into account. There is no loss, or gain, when a prediction of zero is made, and the result is zero. It is much more important to know the result of the trade when a prediction was really made. If I return to this project, the first change I would make is to implement a custom loss function which ignores all predictions of zero.\n"

        "    *   That is, the $i$'th MA to be used will be the $i$'th power of $x$, where I let $x$ vary between 1 and 2.\n",
        "*   Redundancy\n",
        "    *    To make the data easier to parse, any TA indicators that return an absolute price level in any way (e.g. moving averages, bollinger bands, etc.) will instead be returned in terms of relative price level (i.e. percent difference from current price level).\n",
        "*   Trades\n",
        "    *    Trades will be executed using a standardized $100. The goal is to find the percent profit, and so it makes things easier to standardize the trade amount.\n",

Of course, when creating the final product, I will let the numbers decide which indicators I should use.

        "The cornerstone of this approach is the grader function in the code block below. This is a compromise to label the data, since ideally the algorithm would be able to place both long and short orders, as well as vary the amount placed on each trade. However, I do not know of a way to allow the network to calculate the true value of a label during the training, as would be required for such a flexible algorithm.\n",
        "\n",
        "Instead, I train the algorithm to always place long trades with specified stop-loss (SL) and take-profit (TP) levels. These levels are decided based on the following variables:\n",
        "\n",
        "*    Reward/risk ratio: The reward to risk ratio is the ratio of potential profit to the potential loss.\n",
        "*    Profit level: The desired TP level for the trade, in terms of percentage increase.\n",
        "\n",
        "Both the reward to risk ratio and the profit level need to be specified to the grader function. The last missing piece is the amount of data points to check for the specified TP/SL levels. Of course, I could let the algorithm go on forever until either the TP or SL is triggered, but since the algorithm is designed to work on short timescales, I should limit the grader function to work in this scope.\n",
        "\n",
