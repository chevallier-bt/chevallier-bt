# About Me
My name is Benjamin Chevallier, I am a student at the University of Calgary in Alberta, Canada. I am currently pursuing a B.Sc. in Physics. On this GitHub page, I document my personal projects, as well as any work of mine which I am legally permitted to share.

In my time at UCalgary, I learned Python and developped a passion for programming. In my introductory Python course, I started with simple "Hello World" projects just like everyone else. Afterwards, I took computational physics courses where I learned several numerical methods to attack (relatively) challenging problems in physics, usually in statistical mechanics. This deeper dive gave me a taste of the sort of iterative, dynamic problem solving required in programming, and I fell in love, though at this point I was not sure how I wanted to apply this newfound passion.

This passion for programming, which started broad, has now been refined through research and I have discovered that what truly interests me is the world of machine learning.
